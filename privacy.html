                        use and disclosure of information which has been designated as Personal Information or Sensitive Personal Data or Information’ under the SPI Rules requires your express consent. By affirming your assent to this Privacy Policy,
                        you provide your consent to such use, collection and disclosure as required under applicable law. ii. DomestiQue does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Services and, therefore, DomestiQue

                        information regarding the Services, please send us an email at domestique88@gmail.com. v. DomestiQue may require the User to pay with a credit card, wire transfer, debit card or cheque for Services for which subscription amount(s)
                        is/are payable. DomestiQue will collect such User’s credit card number and/or other financial institution information such as bank account numbers and will use that information for the billing and payment processes, including but
                        not limited to the use and disclosure of such credit card number and information to third parties as necessary to complete such billing operation. Verification of credit information, however, is accomplished solely by the User
                        through the authentication process. User’s credit-card/debit card details are transacted upon secure sites of approved payment gateways which are digitally under encryption, thereby providing the highest possible degree of care
                        as per current technology. However, DomestiQue provides you an option not to save your payment details. User is advised, however, that internet technology is not full proof safe and User should exercise discretion on using the
                        same. vi. Due to the communications standards on the Internet, when a User or the End-User or anyone who visits the Platform, DomestiQue automatically receives the URL of the site from which anyone visits. DomestiQue also receives
                        the Internet Protocol (IP) address of each User’s computer (or the proxy server a User used to access the World Wide Web), User’s computer operating system and type of web browser the User is using, email patterns, as well as the
                        name of User’s ISP. This information is used to analyse overall trends to help DomestiQue improve its Service. The linkage between User’s IP address and User’s personally identifiable information is not shared with or disclosed
                        to third parties. Notwithstanding the above, DomestiQue may share and/or disclose some of the aggregate findings (not the specific data) in anonymized form (i.e., non-personally identifiable) with advertisers, sponsors, investors,
                        strategic partners, and others in order to help grow its business. vii. The Platform uses temporary cookies to store certain (that is not sensitive personal data or information) that is used by DomestiQue and its service providers
                        for the technical administration of the Platform, research and development, and for User administration. In the course of serving advertisements or optimizing services to its Users, DomestiQue may allow authorized third parties
                        to place or recognize a unique cookie on the User’s browser. The cookies however, do not store any Personal Information of the User. You may adjust your internet browser to disable cookies. If cookies are disabled you may still
                        use the Platform, but the Platform may be limited in the use of some of the features. viii. This Privacy Policy applies to Services that are owned and operated by DomestiQue. DomestiQue does not exercise control over the sites
                        displayed as search results or links from within its Services. These other sites may place their own cookies or other files on the Users’ computer, collect data or solicit personal information from the Users, for which DomestiQue
                        is not responsible or liable. Accordingly, DomestiQue does not make any representations concerning the privacy practices or policies of such third parties or terms of use of such Platforms, nor does DomestiQue guarantee the accuracy,
                        integrity, or quality of the information, data, text, software, sound, photographs, graphics, videos, messages or other materials available on such Platforms. The inclusion or exclusion does not imply any endorsement by DomestiQue
                        of the Platform, the Platform's provider, or the information on the Platform. If you decide to visit a third party Platform linked to the Platform, you do this entirely at your own risk. DomestiQue encourages the User to read the
                        privacy policies of that Platform. ix. The Platform may enable User to communicate with other Users or to post information to be accessed by others, whereupon other Users may collect such data. Such Users, including any moderators
                        or administrators, are not authorized DomestiQue representatives or agents, and their opinions or statements do not necessarily reflect those of DomestiQue, and they are not authorized to bind DomestiQue to any contract. DomestiQue
                        hereby expressly disclaims any liability for any reliance or misuse of such information that is made available by Users or visitors in such a manner. x. DomestiQue maintains a strict "No-Spam" policy, which means that DomestiQue
                        does not intend to sell, rent or otherwise give your e-mail address to a third party without your consent. xi. DomestiQue implements reasonable security practices and procedures and has a comprehensive documented information security
                        programme and information security policies that contain managerial, technical, operational and physical security control measures that are commensurate with respect to the information being collected and the nature of DomestiQue’s
                        business. xii. DomestiQue takes your right to privacy very seriously and other than as specifically stated in this Privacy Policy, will only disclose your Personal Information in the event it is required to do so by law, rule,
                        regulation, law enforcement agency, governmental official, legal authority or similar requirements or when DomestiQue, in its sole discretion, deems it necessary in order to protect its rights or the rights of others, to prevent
                        harm to persons or property, to fight fraud and credit risk, or to enforce or apply the Terms of Use.
                        <li>CASUAL VISITORS NOTE:</li> <br> ii. No sensitive personal data or information is automatically collected by DomestiQue from any casual visitors of this Platform, who are merely perusing the Platform. <br> iii. Nevertheless, certain
                        provisions of this Privacy Policy are applicable to even such casual visitors, and such casual visitors are also required to read and understand the privacy statements set out herein, failing which they are required to leave this
                        Platform immediately. <br> iv. if you, as a casual visitor, have inadvertently browsed any other page of this Platform prior to reading the privacy statements set out herein, and you do not agree with the manner in which such information
                        is obtained, collected, processed, stored, used, disclosed or retained, merely quitting this browser application should ordinarily clear all temporary cookies installed by DomestiQue. All visitors, however, are encouraged to use
                        the “clear cookies” functionality of their browsers to ensure such clearing / deletion, as DomestiQue cannot guarantee, predict or provide for the behaviour of the equipment of all the visitors of the Platform. <br> v. You are
                        not a casual visitor if you have willingly submitted any personal data or information to DomestiQue through any means, including email, post or through the registration process on the Platform. All such visitors will be deemed
                        to be, and will be treated as, Users for the purposes of this Privacy Policy, and in which case, all the statements in this Privacy Policy apply to such persons. <br>

                </p>
                <h4><strong>4. CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</strong></h4>

                    online environment. These tools also can prevent minors from disclosing their name, address, and other personally identifiable information online without parental permission. Although the DomestiQue Platform and Services are not intended
                    for use by minors, DomestiQue respects the privacy of minors who may inadvertently use the internet or the mobile application. </p>
